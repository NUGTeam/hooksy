If you have Git installed, then you can do `git clone https://github.com/NUGTeam/hooksy.git`, if you don't, you can scroll up and click the "Code" button which is green and then click download ZIP.

Then open command prompt or your preferred terminal and do `cd WHERE_YOUR_CLONE_OR_DOWNLOAD_OF_HOOKSY_IS` and replace `WHERE_YOUR_CLONE_OR_DOWNLOAD_OF_HOOKSY_IS` with, obviously where your clone or download of Hooksy is and run `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

You don't need to do this if you already have an existing clone/download of Hooksy and has already done `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt` in Command Prompt or your preferred terminal.

### Running Hooksy

- Step 1: __If your current working directory isn't where your download/clone of Hooksy is located, do this__. Open command prompt or your preferred terminal and do `cd WHERE_YOUR_CLONE_OR_DOWNLOAD_OF_HOOKSY_IS` and replace `WHERE_YOUR_CLONE_OR_DOWNLOAD_OF_HOOKSY_IS` with, obviously where your clone or download of Hooksy is.
