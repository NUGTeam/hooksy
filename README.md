# hooksy

A python program that sends messages for Discord webhooks. This program is made by 1 idiot.

# Installation

This is the installation guide on how to install Hooksy.

## Easy Way

Go to the [releases](https://github.com/NUGTeam/hooksy/releases) and download the latest version or whatever version you want to download, there should be a ZIP archive attached to it. Download and extract the ZIP archive and run the hooksy.exe file.

If you get an issue like 'Cannot import QtCore from PyQt5' then do it the "Hard Way".

## Hard Way

**DO IT THIS WAY IF YOU ARE A PYTHON DEVELOPER OR IF YOU THINK THE EXECUTABLE IS MALICIOUS**

### Prequisites

- [Python](https://python.org/downloads) 3.8 or later (check the "ADD TO PATH" option in the installation setup)
- (__OPTIONAL__) [Git](https://git-scm.com)

### Downloading/Cloning Hooksy

Please make sure you have the prequisities installed (you don't need to install the optional ones)

If you have Git installed, then you can do `git clone https://github.com/NUGTeam/hooksy.git`, if you don't, you can scroll up and click the "Code" button which is green and then click download ZIP.

Then open command prompt or your preferred terminal and do `cd WHERE_YOUR_CLONE_OR_DOWNLOAD_OF_HOOKSY_IS` and replace `WHERE_YOUR_CLONE_OR_DOWNLOAD_OF_HOOKSY_IS` with, obviously where your clone or download of Hooksy is and run `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

You don't need to do this if you already have an existing clone/download of Hooksy and has already done `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt` in Command Prompt or your preferred terminal.

### Running Hooksy

Please follow these steps in order to run hooksy:
- Step 1: __If your current working directory isn't where your download/clone of Hooksy is located, do this__. Open command prompt or your preferred terminal and do `cd WHERE_YOUR_CLONE_OR_DOWNLOAD_OF_HOOKSY_IS` and replace `WHERE_YOUR_CLONE_OR_DOWNLOAD_OF_HOOKSY_IS` with, obviously where your clone or download of Hooksy is.
- Step 2: Run `py hooksy.pyw`, you may see a couple of errors but don't worry about them!
